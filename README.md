# Phoenix Framework

Phoenix Framework is a game development resource with the goal of providing all the important operations of game development. It is a barebones, modular framework geared towards easy expansion and integration of it's systems.

One thing must be made clear though; this is a a game **framework**. As such, it is useless on it's own and is not meant to add any existing functionality to your game. While it may come with modules and functions that add certain features or functionality to your game, they are not enabled by default. **It is a building block to be be expanded off of and used at the developers discretion.**
